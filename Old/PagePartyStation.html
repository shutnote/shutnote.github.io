  <h3>Party Station</h3>
  <p>Party Station is a playstation 5 game made with unity. Due to an agreement, the project git can not be made public.</p>
  <p>Party Station is a mario party inspired game made for the PS5. it featured six minigames, each of which made use of the different dual sense controller features.</p>
  <p>I made two of the mini-games, assisted with the development of a third and made the main menu mini-games selection screen.</p>
  <p>I overhaulled the main menu to feature a Tournament mode, which randomly picks minigames as well as a level selection. The level selection helped with debugging as well as showcasing.</p>
  <p>I made the Balloon pop minigame made use of the resistive triggers, with players having to rapidly press both triggers whilst they got tougher. The more the pressed, the bigger the balloon got until it popped. Score was rewarded in order of who popped first.</p>
  <p>I made the Hot potato made use of the controllers D-pad, speaker and light bar. A potato was given to the player who must then pass it to everyone else. As time goes on, the potato gets hotter, indicated by the lightbar turning from white to red.</p>
  <p>Bowling was a mini-game I assisted development with. I had to implement the minigames scoring system and the throwing/ball logic. </p>
  <p>Overall this project achieved a 88%</p>
