<p>This is a Mario Party inspired game that was made for the playstation 5. It was a group university project. I made the 
main menu along with two minigames and had to finish up a third before submission. The project achieved an 88% grade.
(Due to an agreement with sony, the project source code nor a playable demo are available so a video will have too do.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<div class="GridContainer">

<button class="GridItem" onclick="Toggle('MainMenu')">Main Menu</button>
<div class="SProjectSubContent" style="display:none;" id="MainMenu">
<img id="WormImg" src="images/UnrealHorror/WormBP.png" onclick="EnlargeImage('WormImg')"></img>
<h4>Main Menu</h4>
<p>I made the main menu. IT allows you to either play a specific mini game or disable them and play 
Tournament mode, which has you all competing across different minigames.</p>
</div>

<button class="GridItem" onclick="Toggle('Balloon')">Balloon pop</button>
<div class="SProjectSubContent" style="display:none;" id="Balloon">
<img id="WormImg" src="images/UnrealHorror/WormBP.png" onclick="EnlargeImage('WormImg')"></img>
<h4>Balloon pop</h4>
<p>Balloon pop is a minigame where you have to blow up the balloon faster than everyone else. This minigame used the 
adaptive triggers to simulate the balloon becoming harder to expand as it gets larger.</p>
</div>

<button class="GridItem" onclick="Toggle('Potato')">Hot Potato</button>
<div class="SProjectSubContent" style="display:none;" id="Potato">
<img id="WormImg" src="images/UnrealHorror/WormBP.png" onclick="EnlargeImage('WormImg')"></img>
<h4>Hot Potato</h4>
<p>Hot Potato is a minigame where you have pass the hot potato to another player before it gets too hot.
 This minigame made extensive use of both the coloured bar light and rumble to indicate how hot the potato was.
 This minigame did not get as much polish as I was hoping for as my attention had to be diverted towards the 
 bowling minigame.</p>
</div>

<button class="GridItem" onclick="Toggle('Bowling')">Bowling</button>
<div class="SProjectSubContent" style="display:none;" id="Bowling">
<img id="WormImg" src="images/UnrealHorror/WormBP.png" onclick="EnlargeImage('WormImg')"></img>
<h4>Bowling</h4>
<p>Whilst this was not my game, I was required to finish it off and make last minuite changes to make the game
 function before submission. This including adding the controller features(Rumble and adaptive triggers) as well
  as fixing the physics of the ball and scoring. This unfortunatly had to be done quickly and resulted in the
  hot Potato minigame not being as polished as I had hoped.</p>
